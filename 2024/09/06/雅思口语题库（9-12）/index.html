<p>I waited for almost half day, but I have no fish, so I was so frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Have you been to the fish market?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I have. Because I am a big fan of eating fish, I always go to the fish market with my mother.</p>
<p>The fish market has strong, special scents, but the dishes made of fish is so fresh and delicious.</p>
<p><strong>Is fishing popular in your country?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think so. </p>
<p>Because of the increasing number of aged population in my country, these elderly people tend to choose a  peaceful activity to <strong>kill their time</strong>.</p>
<p>So most of them can go fishing, and sometimes this activity can make them feel a sense of achievement.</p>

<p>I remember three years ago, I go back to my primary school to see my teachers,</p>
<p>But it is regretful, most of them have retired a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>In what way did your favorite teacher help you?</strong></p>
<p>Because of some hard issues I could not solve it, or the answer I didn’t understand,</p>

<p>To be honest, I don’t want to be a teacher in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Have you seen an unforgettable view?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, i once visited Hainan last sunmer holiday, </p>
<p>i feasted my eyes on sparking waters and radiant sunshine.</p>

<p>Almost exeryday. I think wearing T-shirts can bring me much convenience and flexibility.</p>
<p>and I don’t like spending much time selecting what I should wear.</p>

<p><strong>Did you wear T-shirts when you were a kid?</strong></p>
<p>No, I didn’t. </p>
<p>To be honest, when i was a child, I was so strange that I wasn’t willing to wear normal clothes like T-shirts. </p>
<p>I prefer to wear unconventional clothes to show my personality.</p>
<p><strong>Do you look at other people’s T-shirts?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I often glance at other people’s T-shirts, especially when they have eye-catching designs or colors. </p>
<p>You know, it is boring when walking in the street or taking the subway&#x2F;metro.</p>
<p>So I often pay attention to other people’s clothing.</p>
<p>(Honestly, I rarely focus on other people’s clothing. I find it impolite to scrutinize others in public, so I only notice their outfits if someone makes a particularly striking impression.)</p>
<h3 id="27-Relax"><a href="#27-Relax" class="headerlink" title="27. Relax"></a>27. Relax</h3><p><strong>Where do you go to relax recently?</strong></p>

<p>I would like to talk about <strong>the first-class scholarship</strong> of our university which I earned last year. It is big thing that I <strong>am proud of.</strong> (When)</p>
